Homework 

The program relocation.py allows you to see how address translations are performed in a system with base and bounds registers. See the README for details. 



Questions 

(1) Run with seeds 1, 2, and 3, and compute whether each virtual address generated by the process is in or out of bounds. <u>If in bounds, compute the translation</u>.

```
(seed:1)
Base-and-Bounds register information:

  Base   : 0x0000363c (decimal 13884)
  Limit  : 290

Virtual Address Trace
  VA  0: 0x0000030e (decimal:  782) --> v
  VA  1: 0x00000105 (decimal:  261) --> 0x3741
  VA  2: 0x000001fb (decimal:  507) --> v
  VA  3: 0x000001cc (decimal:  460) --> v
  VA  4: 0x0000029b (decimal:  667) --> v
```



```
(seed:2)
Base-and-Bounds register information:

  Base   : 0x00003ca9 (decimal 15529)
  Limit  : 500

Virtual Address Trace
  VA  0: 0x00000039 (decimal:   57) --> 0x3ce2
  VA  1: 0x00000056 (decimal:   86) --> 0x3cff
  VA  2: 0x00000357 (decimal:  855) --> violation
  VA  3: 0x000002f1 (decimal:  753) --> v
  VA  4: 0x000002ad (decimal:  685) --> v
```

```
(seed:3)
Base-and-Bounds register information:

  Base   : 0x000022d4 (decimal 8916)
  Limit  : 316

Virtual Address Trace
  VA  0: 0x0000017a (decimal:  378) --> v
  VA  1: 0x0000026a (decimal:  618) --> v
  VA  2: 0x00000280 (decimal:  640) --> v
  VA  3: 0x00000043 (decimal:   67) --> 0x2317
  VA  4: 0x0000000d (decimal:   13) --> 0x22e1

For each virtual address, either write down the physical address it translates to
OR write down that it is an out-of-bounds address (a segmentation violation). For
this problem, you should assume a simple virtual address space of a given size.
```

(2) Run with these flags: -s 0 -n 10. What value do you have set -l (the bounds register) to in order to ensure that all the generated virtual addresses are within bounds? 

```sh
$ python3 relocation.py -s 0 -n 10 -l 930 -c
                                    ^
```

(3) Run with these flags: -s 1 -n 10 -l 100. What is the maximum value that base can be set to, such that the address space still fits into physical memory in its entirety? 

```
$ python3 relocation.py -s 1 -n 10 -l 100 -b 15900 -c
                                           ^
```

(4) Run some of the same problems above, but with larger address spaces (-a) and physical memories (-p). 

(5) What fraction of randomly-generated virtual addresses are valid, as a function of the value of the bounds register? Make a graph from running with different random seeds, with limit values ranging from 0 up to the maximum size of the address space.
